# Pinterest Node for n8n - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a comprehensive Pinterest node for the n8n workflow automation platform. The Pinterest node will enable users to integrate Pinterest's functionality into their automated workflows, allowing seamless interaction with Pinterest's API services including pins, boards, user profiles, and media management.

The node will serve content creators, marketers, e-commerce businesses, and developers who need to automate Pinterest workflows and integrate Pinterest data with other systems through n8n's visual workflow environment.

1. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL support JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats up to 10MB
2. WHEN uploading videos THEN the system SHALL support MP4 and MOV formats up to 100MB
3. WHEN processing media uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file formats, sizes, and dimensions
4. WHEN media upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide upload status and progress information
5. IF media upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about format, size, or other issues
6. WHEN media is successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL return media ID and URL for pin creation

### Requirement 5: User Profile and Analytics Access

**User Story:** As a marketing analyst, I want to access Pinterest user profile information and analytics data, so that I can track performance and make data-driven decisions about Pinterest strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving user profile THEN the system SHALL return username, display name, bio, avatar, account type, and verification status
2. WHEN accessing user analytics THEN the system SHALL provide impression, save, click, and engagement metrics
3. WHEN retrieving pin analytics THEN the system SHALL return performance data including impressions, saves, clicks, and audience demographics
4. WHEN accessing board analytics THEN the system SHALL provide board-level performance metrics and insights
5. IF analytics data is not available THEN the system SHALL indicate data availability limitations clearly
6. WHEN analytics requests exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry appropriately

### Requirement 6: Search and Discovery Features

**User Story:** As a content researcher, I want to search Pinterest content and access trending information, so that I can discover relevant content and identify trending topics for my strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for pins THEN the system SHALL support keyword-based search with filtering options
2. WHEN searching for boards THEN the system SHALL return relevant boards with metadata and statistics
3. WHEN accessing trending content THEN the system SHALL provide popular pins, topics, and hashtags
4. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large result sets
5. IF search queries are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and suggestions
6. WHEN search rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate delays

### Requirement 7: Rate Limiting and Performance Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Pinterest node to respect API rate limits and perform efficiently, so that workflows remain stable and don't exceed Pinterest's usage policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL track and respect Pinterest's rate limits (1000 requests/hour/user)
